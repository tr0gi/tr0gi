"Praise malware and upgrade the standards"

I code in Rust, PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and I'm working on getting OSCP.\
I like working with cryptography and I'm an avid Bitcoin maxi. I strongly believe in decentralization and peer-to-peer internet protocols.\
I strive to make the internet a freer and safer place, on a global scale.\
