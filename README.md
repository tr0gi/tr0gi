## Hey, I'm Matteo.
I strive to make the internet a freer and safer place, on a global scale.

"Praise malware and upgrade the standards" - Me

I code in Rust, PHP, MySQL, HTML & CSS. I have experience with Nginx, VirtualBox, WordPress and WHMCS.

I strongly believe in decentralization and peer-to-peer internet protocols.
