I strongly believe in the use of cryptography for privacy.  
I code in Rust, PHP and MySQL.  

> Praise malware and upgrade the standards - me

## Philosophy
I align with the philosophies expressed in:
- [The Cypherpunk Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html) - *Privacy through technology, not policy*
- [The GNU Manifesto](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html) - *Software freedom as a fundamental right*
